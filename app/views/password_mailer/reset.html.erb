Hi <%= params[:user].email %>

someone requested a reset of your password.

If this was you, click the link to reset your password. The link will expire automatically in 15 minutes. 

<%= link_to "Reset password", password_reset_edit_url(token: @token)  %>

<%# you have to use url instead of path here since these links will be click on from the users email address. Path only does relative paths %>
